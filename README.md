## Welcome to the Bounding-Box-Abstract-Specification GitHub repository

At the OGC Architecture Board Meeting on 2021-05-11, there was discussion of how should OGC define in the Abstract Specification a model for describing bounding boxes that is inclusive of all uses in OGC Standards?

Secondary question: what working group has ownership of this concept?

Or maybe that is the primary question, and why the supporting models are either missing or at best hard to find?

### Issues for discussion

### We need to agree:

    Conceptual model - well established in mathematics
    Do we need to cover convex hulls, envelopes, etc.?
    Do we need to clarify number of dimensions? (e.g. weather forcasts have (x,y,z,t + t1), digital twins could have doubling (x,y,z,t + x1,y1,z1,t1))
    Terminology â€“ much is OGC specific, perhaps unnecessarily
    Encoding in specific contexts
    Encoding for specific special cases (e.g. calendar time, discrete dimensions)
    May need best practices.
